						Saving Money on Medication: 7 Practical Tips
					</h1>
					<article>
						<p>
							Staying healthy is practical, trendy, and also economically
							beneficial, while being sick becomes more expensive from year to
							year. According to RxPrice Watch Report, in the US an annual
							supply of one brand name drug costed an average of $6800 in 2016.
							Older Americans take 4.5 different prescription drugs monthly, and
							drug prices increase by almost 9% annually. The problem of
							increasing medication costs is being especially critical for
							people with chronic ailments who permanently depends on expensive
							drugs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consumers may not be able to influence pharmaceutical corporations
							and their pricing policies, but saving on medicines is possible by
							making rational choices. These 7 practical tips will help you
							reduce the cost of both prescription and OTC drugs.
						</p>
						<h2>Check low-cost alternatives</h2>
						<p>
							Doctors often prescribe expensive and widely advertised drugs,
							which sometimes don’t have cheaper equivalents. However, expensive
							brand-name medications often DO have low-cost alternatives also
							known as generics. Generics are copies of original brand-name
							drugs with the same intended use, positive effects and risks.
							People tend to believe that significant price difference between
							branded and generic drugs is caused by inferior quality or
							efficiency. In reality, generics cost less because their
							manufacturers don’t bear the costs of product development and
							marketing. The FDA requires that generics have the same
							therapeutic effect as their original counterparts.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a dramatic example, 60 tablets of Vimolo, which contains
							naproxen and esomeprazole as its active agents, cost around
							$2,500–3,000 in the US. Alternatively, buying 60 tablets of
							generic naproxen and esomeprazole separately will cost less than
							$50. Similarly, there are no substantial grounds to believe that
							the expensive Bystolic used for high blood pressure is better than
							its cheaper alternatives, carvedilol and metoprolol.
						</p>
						<h2>Compare prices in different pharmacies</h2>
						<p>
							Different pharmacies may set different prices for the same
							product. Before buying drugs, particularly the expensive ones, it
							is highly recommended to analyze prices in a number of pharmacies.
							Although it might sound complicated, prices are often found on the
							pharmacy’s website; several online services offer convenient drug
							price comparison, which covers major drugstores based on your
							location. In addition, avoid buying medicines in pharmacies
							located in shopping centers and strip malls. You may notice that
							pharmacies located in their vicinity tend to set higher prices:
							typically, this is due to the higher cost of rental space.
						</p>
						<h2>Learn about foreign alternatives</h2>
						<p>
							Prices for medicines and medical services in different
							geographical locations can vary so much that it becomes more cost
							effective to purchase them in another city or country. Insulin
							price crisis has sent Americans traveling all the way to Canada in
							order to purchase the life-saving drug, which costs about 10 times
							less in the neighboring country. The difference in price is
							startling: $30 vs $300 for a vial of the same product. From
							California alone, an estimated 1 million people travel to Mexico
							for prescription drugs and health services.
						</p>
						<p>
							Soon there may be even more reasons to cross the border for health
							reasons. The Canadian government has announced new regulations
							that will come into force on July 1, 2020. The new regulations
							will be aimed at reducing prices on prescription drugs and
							protecting consumers from excessive prices set by pharmaceutical
							companies.
						</p>
						<h2>Follow the correct administration procedure</h2>
						<p>
							Spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on prescription and
							OTC drugs monthly, patients can neglect the correct administration
							procedure, which is necessary to achieve the intended effect.
							Taking medication with coffee instead of water, mixing drugs with
							alcohol, or not following the before/after meal regimen can reduce
							the therapeutic effect, which makes the money at least partially
							wasted. Moreover, some drugs enhance each other’s effects, for
							example, iron and vitamin C preparations. There are also
							medications that work more efficiently at certain times of the day
							(in particular, calcium preparations are recommended to be taken
							at night). By taking drugs correctly consumers will avoid higher
							medication costs associated with buying more drugs due to lower
							efficiency.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many conditions — in particular liver, heart, and kidney diseases
							— are highly dependent on lifestyle. Thus, a dose of expensive
							medication can go to waste because of a wrong lunch choice. Diet
							and regimen are also a way of treatment, and they have to be
							strictly observed: otherwise, you risk leaving your money in the
							pharmacy without any positive health results.
						</p>
						<h2>Avoid buying medication in high season</h2>
						<p>
							No matter how absurd it may sound in relation to pharmaceuticals,
							it is better to avoid buying medication in high season. In other
							words, people with pollen allergy who commonly suffer allergy
							attacks in spring are advised to buy antihistamine drugs shortly
							before the pollen season in March-April. Purchasing “seasonal”
							drugs in advance is cheaper and also won’t play a significant role
							in terms of expiration date. In the cold season, the demand for
							antiviral drugs increases, so their prices rise notably during
							October-November and January-February. To save money on cold and
							flu remedies, buy them in September: they surely will be useful
							for the long fall-winter period, and the savings can turn out
							significant.
						</p>
						<h2>When traveling, prepare a first-aid kit in advance</h2>
						<p>
							Imagine how much can a simple over-the-counter drug cost you in
							popular resort areas. The same goes for motion sickness remedies
							at the airports and bus stations. Moreover, finding a necessary
							drug abroad may be difficult due to language barriers and
							difference in products available in the local pharmaceutical
							market.
						</p>
						<h2>Don’t take medication “just in case”</h2>
						<p>
							Think twice before purchasing drugs with unproven effectiveness,
							homeopathic remedies, and health fraud products, since they may
							not only waste money but also delay proper treatment. For
							instance, there is a common belief that after antibiotic
							treatment, probiotics should be taken to regain the natural
							bacterial flora in the intestines. Consumers should note that
							probiotics and other widely advertised products have no proven
							effect and may be useless for therapeutic means. Moreover,
							digestion doesn’t necessarily deteriorate after taking
							antibiotics.
